I’m Joel Kofi Amoako, but most people call me <u>Ceejay</u>. I am a software engineer based in Accra, Ghana, and I have been writing code for more than six years. My work has always leaned toward backend engineering and cloud infrastructure, where I focus on building reliable, scalable systems that people and businesses can depend on.  

Over the years I have worked on a wide range of projects. I have built WebRTC platforms for real-time video conferencing and recording, chat systems that needed to handle heavy concurrency, management systems for organizations, payment and financial integrations, and full cloud infrastructure setups for products that had to stay online no matter the traffic. Each project has pushed me to solve problems in distributed systems, system design, and debugging under pressure. I enjoy the entire process, from the first design sketches to the moment the system is stable in production.  

I work comfortably across languages and environments, but I am at my best when working with Go, Node.js, and Python for backend development, and with PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis, and Kafka when the job calls for databases and messaging. I design APIs, tune performance, set up deployment pipelines, and manage infrastructure with Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud providers like AWS and GCP. The technical side of my work excites me, but what really keeps me going is the challenge of making systems that are both elegant in design and practical in the real world.  

My relationship with technology started long before I became a professional. I grew up using Unix systems, and that early curiosity shaped how I think about computing. I have hopped across countless Linux distributions, daily-drive Arch Linux today, experimented with BSD, and even built my own custom Linux distribution from scratch. That journey taught me not just how computers work but how to take control of them, break things, and rebuild them better. It also gave me the confidence to dive deep into problems that others might shy away from, because I know from experience that there is always a way through with enough patience and curiosity.  

Beyond engineering, I like to keep my life balanced with different interests. I enjoy gardening, reading about health and nutrition, and following the evolving world of cryptocurrency and its impact on technology and money. Photography also gives me a creative outlet outside of code. These hobbies keep me grounded and help me bring fresh perspectives back into my engineering work.  

I see myself primarily as a backend and cloud engineer who thrives in environments where reliability, scalability, and performance are non-negotiable. But I am also someone who loves learning, experimenting, and sharing ideas. If you want to collaborate, exchange thoughts, or simply talk about systems, open source, or the future of technology, I’m always happy to connect.
