Iâ€™m Joel Amoako, but you can just call me <u>Ceejay</u>. Iâ€™m based in Accra, Ghana, and I spend most of my time building backend systems and helping others bring their ideas to life.

Iâ€™ve been coding for over 6 years now, mainly working on backend development, cloud infrastructure, and the occasional WebRTC project. While Iâ€™ve dabbled in frontend frameworks like Next.js, Vue, and Angular, my real passion lies in backend engineeringâ€”making things reliable and scalable behind the scenes.

Outside of work, I keep myself busy with gardening, reading about health and nutrition, snapping photos here and there, and following the crypto space. Iâ€™m a big fan of crypto and love exploring how itâ€™s shaping the future of tech and money.

Thanks for stopping by, and feel free to reach out if you want to chat, share ideas, or collaborate on something fun. ðŸ©¶
