Hey, Iâ€™m Joel Amoako, but most people just call me <u>Ceejay</u>. I live in Accra, Ghana, and I spend a lot of my time building software and sometimes helping others build theirs too.

Iâ€™ve been at this for about 6 years now, bouncing between backend stuff, WebRTC experiments, and playing around with frontend frameworks like Next.js, Vue, and Angular. Most of the time Iâ€™m either putting together backends for cloud systems or tinkering with how an interface looks and feels.

When Iâ€™m not in front of my laptop, I like keeping it simpleâ€”gardening, reading about health and nutrition, messing around with photography, or just doing random side projects. One of my weird hobbies is redesigning the apps I use every day, just to see how much nicer they could feel with a little UI love.

Iâ€™m always open to meeting new people, trading ideas, or working on something fun. If that sounds like you, letâ€™s link up. ðŸ©¶
