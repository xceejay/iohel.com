I am Joel Kofi Amoako, but most people call me <u>Ceejay</u>. I live in Accra, Ghana, and I have been writing code for more than six years. My main focus is backend and cloud work, where I enjoy building systems that can scale and stay online when it matters most.  

Over time I have worked on video platforms, chat apps, payment systems, and infrastructure that had to run smoothly no matter the load. I like solving tough problems in system design, performance, and reliability. My favorite tools include Go, Node.js, Python, and databases like PostgreSQL and Redis. I also enjoy working with Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud platforms such as AWS and GCP.  

I started early with Unix and Linux, experimenting with countless systems and even building my own distribution. That curiosity still drives how I approach problems today.  

Outside of engineering, I like to read, garden, follow new ideas in crypto, and take photos. Photography gives me a way to create something outside of code.
