Hi, I'm Joel Amoako, also known as coder Amoako. I'm a software engineer passionate about interface design and web experiences. I reside in Accra, Ghana.

For over 6 years, I've been on a journey in the world of UX/UI, having initially trained as an interface designer. I focus on developing and designing user-centered web and mobile applications, as well as marketing sites.

In my free time, I enjoy spending quality time with my family and friends.

I'm an avid reader of Sci-Fi, books about digital products, and technology. I also create educational content by recording videos and developing courses about web development. One of my favorite activities is refactoring the UI of products I use daily to improve their user experience.

I'm always happy to connect and collaborate. Let's work together! ðŸ§¡
