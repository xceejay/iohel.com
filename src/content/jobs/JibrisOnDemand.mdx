Co-founded a WebRTC recording platform (PaaS) that could automatically join live meetings, record them, generate transcripts, and stream sessions directly to platforms like StreamYard and YouTube.  
I worked on the core architecture, scaling real-time media pipelines, and ensuring low-latency integrations with third-party services.
