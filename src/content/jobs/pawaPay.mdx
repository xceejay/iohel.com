I help developers integrate with pawaPayâ€™s APIs and build reliable Mobile Money payment solutions.  
My work spans designing integration flows, writing scripts to automate UATs, debugging and optimizing API requests, and collaborating with our engineering team to solve technical issues.  
I also contribute to our API docs and code examples, making the developer experience smoother and more intuitive.
