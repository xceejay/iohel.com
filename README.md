# CVfolio

**Welcome to CVfolio!**. CVfolio is an minimalistic and aesthetic Astro template for developers and designers to showcase their professional journey, portfolio, and expertise in a modern, fast-loading website inspired by Read.CV.

The source code is still being worked on, so **it's important to share it** with you so we can get feedback and constantly improve it.

Over time, we've managed to add features and improve the design. There are still some things left to do, but the most important thing is that there's an opportunity for this project to be **community-driven**.
